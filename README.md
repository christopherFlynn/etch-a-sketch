# etch-a-sketch

This project focuses on the utilization of the DOM in Javascript to create, remove, and style HTML elements through accessing nodes and styling/resetting them with functions. This webpage simulates an etch-a-sketch, where the user can color in the grid with random colors and can also control the size of the grid.

I learned how to use the DOM on a basic level, how to streamline the creation of HTML and CSS using JS, and more problem solving skills through the use of webpage devtools.
